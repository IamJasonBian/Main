#### Hydroponic Sensoring within Cannibus Industries

As of 2021, cannabis is legal to grow within designated green zones or by med card holders in 18 states. Most growers start as local caregivers using basements, attics, and smaller rooms with custom air filters, ventilation systems, and humidity control. Many manual tasks are involved in nutrient mixing, pest control, potting and pruning. Deviations in atmospheric conditions as well as downtime of several components in smaller custom setups can cause significant damage to plant health. Here, we analyze three common systems used for small and mid-tier growers as they transition to additional sensoring automation due to labor demands. 


#### Yolink

Often, local systems like Yolink are used with a subscription-based structure to control light and temperature sensors using local Wi-Fi networks.
