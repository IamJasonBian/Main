## Welcome to Hardy 

I hope you enjoy your stay as much as I did traveling in this vehicle! Below are instructions on operating the van.

**Hot Water**: To use hot water, turn on the hot water generater below the van as shown:

1. Open the cabinent below the sink
2. Plug in the hot water heater
3. Turn the dial to the very end
    1. This tank holds 4 gallons and takes approximately 15 minutes to heat up. 
    2. Please unplug the water heater after use to conserve electricity.

**Water Faucet**:
There is a detachable hose in the sink. Push the faucet back for cold water and push the facuet forward for hot water. 

**Showers**:
The shower room can be found under the wooden countertop. To setup the shower:

1. Lift up the wooden table top
2. Remove the toilet 
3. Enclose the curtains around the space
4. Attach the showerhead up top
5. Turn hose to redirect the hot water into the shower (If hot water is setup)

**Toilet** (#2 prefered):
To use the toilet, open the cassete at the bottom on the toilet. 
The toilet is best for number 1 due to limited capacity.

**Electric Capacity**
1. Capacity: Total Capacity of the van is 8.8 kwH. Given baseline consumption (Fridge, van, lights, inverter), solar is enough to sustain full charge. 

2. Monitoring: When the voltage reaches 25.5 on the inverter, the van has roughly 20% battery left and need to be charged.
3. App Monitoring via inverter sensor: There is a charging app with the following login and password:

            Login:
            Pass

4. The van can be charged at chargepoint stations with level 1 and level 2 chargers:

5. Generator Charging: If the battery dies, the generator can be used to jump start the van. THIS SHOULD BE AVOIDED as the inverted would die as well and prevent solar charging.

    5.1. To charge via generater:
