### Components of CRM

Customer Relationship Management aims to get a single integrated view of customers. We can break down CRM into:

* Operational CRM: Refers to services targeted toward customers to solve customer point points.
* Collaborative CRM: Communciation between customers and the system
* Analytics CRM: Integrated framework of product and service decision-making against pricing and new product introduction

We refer to CRM with the goal of achieving higher profits and sales via customer satisfaction/reduced buying and selling costs.

4. Customization: Customize products so customers are treated uniquely with all demands fulfilled.
